## About
This is my submission for the Code2040 API Challenge.
I decided to use a website as an interface and have the functions for the different stages in the challenge.js javascript files. If you look at the file you will see that the functions for every stage are separated in blocks.

Here is the description of the Stages:

================================
Stage I: Reverse a string
================================
The first stage is to reverse a string.

================================
Stage II: Needle in a haystack
================================
The first value, needle, is a string. The second value, haystack, is an array of strings. The function is going  to tell the API where the needle is in the array.

================================
Stage III: Prefix
================================
The first value, prefix, is a string. The second value, array, is an array of strings. The functions job is to return an array containing only the strings that do not start with that prefix.

================================
Stage IV: The dating game
================================
The value for datestamp is a string, formatted as an ISO 8601 datestamp. The value for interval is a number of seconds. The function the interval to the date, then return the resulting date to the API.

I hope you like my work and thanks for taking me in consideration.
